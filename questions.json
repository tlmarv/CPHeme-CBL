    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is the extensor carpi radialis brevis, extensor digitorum, extensor digiti minimi, and extensor carpi ulnaris (B). These are the extensor muscles of the posterior forearm that originate from the lateral epicondyle or common extensor origin. Overuse of the extensors stresses extensor tendons, leading to pain over the lateral condyle, or tennis elbow. The biceps brachii (short head) (A) is a forearm flexor, not extensor. The opponens pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis, and flexor pollicis brevis (C) originate from the flexor retinaculum and act on the thumb. The pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, and flexor carpi ulnaris (D) are flexors that may be injured by flexor overuse (golfer elbow), producing pain over the medial epicondyle with flexion."

    "question": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of pain and stiffness in both of her hands for the past 3 weeks. The pain is most severe early in the day and does not respond to ibuprofen. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Examination shows swelling and tenderness of the wrists and metacarpophalangeal joints bilaterally. Range of motion is decreased due to pain. There are subcutaneous, nontender, firm, mobile nodules on the extensor surface of the forearm. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's current symptoms?",

        "Sulfasalazine",
        "Prednisone"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "Glucocorticoids like prednisone act rapidly to reduce symptoms of severe acute flares of RA. A short course of glucocorticoids has been shown to be more effective than NSAID therapy in reducing joint tenderness and pain and can be used to bridge the period until DMARDs, which are prescribed on a long-term basis to control disease activity, take effect."

Antibiotics are given to address any underlying infections, but because he has symptomatic arthritis, NSAIDs should be started for symptomatic relief. None of the remaining listed drugs is used in reactive arthritis. Anti–IL-17 agents (A) are used for very severe psoriatic arthritis. Methotrexate (C) is used in severe psoriatic arthritis.

Today she complains of leg pain, along with fever and redness of the upper part of her leg. A diagnosis of osteomyelitis was made; however, no organisms were identified despite all the blood tests that were done. Blood cultures have been negative three times. What is the best next step in management?",
        "choices": [
            "Blood cultures",
            "Bone biopsy",
            "Bone scan",
            "Complete blood count",
            "MRI of the bone"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is bone biopsy (B). Bone biopsy is the most definitive diagnostic test in cases where blood cultures are negative, as it can identify the causative organism directly from the infected bone."

    "question": "A 27-year-old man comes to the clinic because of pain and blurry vision in his right eye for the past week. He also notes a 3-month history of progressive low back and hip pain and stiffness. The pain wakes him up at night, feels worse in the morning, and improves with activity. On physical examination, the right eye is erythematous, with decreased visual acuity. There is decreased range of motion when bending at the waist. Which of the following human leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtypes would most likely be present in this patient's cells?",
    "choices": [
        "HLA-B27",
        "HLA-B8",
        "HLA-DQ8",
        "HLA-DR2",
        "HLA-DR4"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is HLA-B27 (A). The patient's symptoms of progressive low back pain and uveitis (eye inflammation) are characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis, which is commonly associated with the HLA-B27 genotype. This condition primarily affects the axial skeleton and often presents with pain that is worse in the morning and improves with movement."

    "question": "A 26-year-old man comes to the clinic because of several years of back pain. He reports stiffness upon waking that improves with exercise. He also reports occasional hip pain. On physical examination, hip flexion, hip extension, and flexion of the lower back are limited. There is tenderness on palpation over the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints. Which of the following is the most likely finding on diagnostic imaging?",
    "choices": [
        "Fusion of lumbar vertebrae",
        "Lateral curvature of the spine",
        "Lumbar disc herniation",
        "Osteophytes in the intervertebral joints",
        "Pannus formation",
        "Vertebral compression fractures"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is fusion of lumbar vertebrae (A). The patient's chronic back pain, morning stiffness that improves with exercise, and limited range of motion are characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis. This condition often leads to fusion of the vertebrae, particularly in the lumbar and sacroiliac regions, which would be observed on imaging. Other options are less consistent with this presentation."

    "question": "A 38-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to his physician for evaluation of swelling in his right middle finger, left hand, and right foot over the past 3 weeks. Physical examination reveals marked erythema and edema in the swollen joints. Both elbows have well-demarcated pink plaques with thick, silvery scale. Which of the following is most likely to also be seen in this patient?",
    "choices": [
        "Antigliadin antibodies",
        "Nail pits",
        "Negatively birefringent crystals in joint fluid",
        "Positive rheumatoid factor",
        "Weakly positively birefringent crystals in joint fluid"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is nail pits (B). The presentation of pink plaques with silvery scale is suggestive of psoriasis. Psoriatic arthritis, which is associated with psoriasis, commonly presents with joint swelling and erythema. Nail pits are a classic finding in psoriatic arthritis. Antigliadin antibodies (A) are associated with celiac disease, negatively birefringent crystals (C) indicate gout, positive rheumatoid factor (D) is seen in rheumatoid arthritis, and weakly birefringent crystals (E) are indicative of calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD)."

He suffered a career-ending fracture there three years ago which required surgery for re-alignment of the bone edges. He has had chronic pain and swelling in the region of the surgical incision, but no fever, chills, or sweats. On exam, the area is red swollen and draining purulent material through a fistulous tract. His CBC reveals a mild normochromic, normocytic anemia.

Two days prior to the onset of symptoms, she was bitten by her cat at the site. On exam, she has a fever of 100.8oF, but is not toxic-appearing. The involved joint is red, tender, and has obvious fluid. A Gram’s stain of joint aspirate will most likely show which of the following?",

    "question": "A 39-year-old man is referred to an orthopedic surgeon because of a draining wound in the region of his distal right tibia for a week. A year ago, he sustained a fracture in a flag football game which required surgery for re-alignment of the bone edges. He has had chronic pain and redness in the region of the surgical incision, but no fever, chills, or sweats. On exam, the area is red and swollen and draining purulent material through a fistulous tract. A CBC reveals a mild anemia. An x-ray shows a lucent area in the bone and the suggestion of an involucrum.\n\nThe next appropriate step in management is which of the following?",
    "choices": [
        "A. Debride the bone and fill defect with antibiotic beads",
        "B. Debride the bone and perform smears and cultures of the bone and give long-term antibiotics based on results of microbiology studies",
        "C. Draw blood cultures and begin empirical antibiotics; adjust after culture results are available",
        "D. Give 4-6 weeks of antibiotics on the basis of Gram’s stain and culture of the drainage",
        "E. Perform needle aspirate of involved bone and begin 4-6 weeks of antibiotics based on culture results"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is (B). In chronic osteomyelitis, especially in cases with evidence of an involucrum, it is essential to debride necrotic bone, perform cultures to guide antibiotic therapy, and provide long-term antibiotic treatment based on culture results. This approach ensures thorough removal of infected tissue and proper targeting of causative organisms, which is critical for managing chronic infections. In general, all dead bone must be removed to cure chronic osteomyelitis."
