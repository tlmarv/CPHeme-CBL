This child was born with α-thalassemia. α-Thalassemia due to four allele deletions is incompatible with life and often presents as hydrops fetalis due to circulating tetramers of γ-globulin (hemoglobin Barts). In this type of α-thalassemia, hemoglobin electrophoresis, which measures and identifies the different types of hemoglobin within the bloodstream, shows the presence of hemoglobin Barts. A direct antiglobulin test (DAT) (A) is positive in autoimmune hemolytic anemias but not in thalassemia. Osmotic fragility testing (C) measures the fragility of RBCs; it is often abnormal in hereditary spherocytosis but is normal in α-thalassemia. A white blood cell differential (D) can be useful when diagnosing inflammation and infections but does not give information that is helpful for diagnosing thalassemia."

In a woman of childbearing age with a microcytic anemia, iron-deficiency anemia due to heavy menses is most likely and is supported by the anisocytosis on the blood smear, along with the increased RBC distribution width (RDW). G6PD deficiency (A) is a hemolytic anemia that would be normocytic. Megaloblastic anemia (C) is macrocytic. A microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (D) such as TTP or HUS would be normocytic and would likely show schistocytes on the blood smear, as well as low platelets. Thalassemia (E) is not likely, because the RDW is increased (it is normal or decreased in thalassemia) and the red blood cell (RBC) count is decreased (it is increased in thalassemia)."

The patient presents with signs and symptoms of anemia and is found to have a macrocytic (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] 105 fL) anemia on complete blood count (CBC). Hypersegmented neutrophils are present in the blood, which is diagnostic of megaloblastic anemia (usually B12 or folate deficiency). Heavy alcohol use (B) may cause a macrocytic anemia, but it would be nonmegaloblastic and lack hypersegmented neutrophils as seen here. Hereditary spherocytosis (C) is a hemolytic anemia that is normocytic, not macrocytic. Myelodysplastic syndrome (D) sometimes presents with a macrocytic anemia but does not show megaloblastic changes (such as hypersegmented neutrophils) in the blood; it may also show low white blood cells (WBCs) or platelets.

    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is vascular constriction (E). Blood vessels immediately constrict after an injury. The effects are two-fold: blood leakage is reduced, and blood flow is slowed down so that coagulation factors can exert their effect at the trauma site. Activation of factor X (A) occurs during secondary hemostasis. Fibrinolysis (B), the dissolution of clots, occurs after hemostasis—that is, once the hemorrhage stops and healing begins. The formation of fibrin (C), like the activation of factor X, occurs during secondary hemostasis, after platelet plug formation (D)."

    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is platelet plug reinforcement (D). The coagulation cascade is also known as secondary hemostasis. Its main function is to produce fibrin, the molecule in charge of reinforcing the soft platelet plug. Activation of platelets (A) occurs after subendothelial collagen is exposed during injury. Creation of a platelet plug (B) is alternatively known as primary hemostasis, and platelet degranulation (C) also occurs after subendothelial collagen is exposed during injury. Although thromboplastin is involved in the coagulation cascade, thromboplastin formation (E) is not the main objective."

    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is plasmin (C). Plasmin is the main protein involved in thrombolysis, the process of dissolving clots or breaking up clots in blood vessels. Antithrombin (A) is an important regulatory molecule of the coagulation cascade; it stops the formation of fibrin but does not dissolve any fibrin that has already been formed. Fibrinogen (B) and plasminogen (D) are inactive molecules known as zymogens and can only be activated by enzymes (many coagulation factors are enzymes). Thrombin (E) is a key factor in the coagulation cascade because it activates many other coagulation factors."

    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is tissue factor (E). The first step in forming fibrin in vivo is the appearance of tissue factor, which initiates coagulation along the extrinsic pathway. Factors V (A) and X (B) are enzyme precursors that are part of the final common pathway. High-molecular-weight kininogen (C) can initiate coagulation along the intrinsic pathway (like in a test tube), but this is not the first step in the coagulation cascade in the body. Thrombin (D) can also initiate coagulation along the intrinsic pathway (and it does so after the extrinsic pathway is shut down!), but this is not the first step in the process."

{

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is tissue factor kicks off the extrinsic arm of the cascade, but this arm is soon shut off, and fibrin formation is completed using the intrinsic arm (D). Start with TF (and the extrinsic pathway), then the extrinsic pathway gets shut down, and thrombin kicks off the intrinsic pathway, which ends up doing all the work.

The outcome of HITT is thrombosis, so we want to make sure the patient is anticoagulated, and we do that with a direct thrombin inhibitor like argatroban. We use intravenous heparin to treat DVTs (B). We use warfarin or direct Xa inhibitors in atrial fibrillation (A) to prevent ischemic strokes (D) caused by emboli forming in the atria.

    "explanation": "The correct answer is hemorrhagic (i.e., bleeding) stroke (C). Warfarin is metabolized by liver enzymes, and if these liver enzymes are inhibited, warfarin's metabolism is decreased, ultimately increasing warfarin concentration in the blood and increasing the risk of a bleed. Budd-Chiari syndrome (A) is post-hepatic flow obstruction caused by thrombosis. DVTs (B) and pulmonary emboli (D) are also caused by thrombosis. All three of these cases are examples of clotting and would occur in the scenario of a liver P450 enzyme inducer rather than an inhibitor. Thrombocytopenia (E) is a potential side effect of heparin therapy (e.g., HITT)."
