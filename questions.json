    "choices": [
        "She is automatically eligible for Medicaid due to her unemployment status.",
        "She may not qualify if her income is above the state-specific threshold.",
        "She is eligible for Medicaid because it covers all uninsured adults.",
        "She can enroll in Medicare instead."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Eligibility for Medicaid depends on state-specific thresholds, and she may not qualify if her state has not expanded coverage."

        "Estrogen",
        "NSAIDs",
        "Vitamin D"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is bisphosphonates (A). Paget disease is treated with bisphosphonates as they work by inhibiting osteoclast activity. Estrogen (B) induces apoptosis in osteoclasts and is a potential treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. NSAIDs (C) allow for pain control but are not the first-line treatment in Paget disease. Vitamin D supplementation (D) is used to treat osteomalacia and rickets."

    "question": "A 4-year-old girl is brought to the pediatrician’s office. Her mother says that she noticed that her legs seem unsteady and bowed when the girl stands. She noticed this for the first time 2 months ago. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
        "Osteopenia",
        "Osteoporosis",
        "Paget disease",
        "Rickets"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is rickets (D). Rickets often occurs in children aged 6-23 months or 12-15 years because of vitamin D deficiency and presents with genu varum, or bow legs. Osteoporosis (B) is a disorder of decreased bone mineral density that is common in postmenopausal women and caused by factors such as old age and decreased estrogen levels. Osteopenia (A) is a milder loss of bone mineral density that is a precursor to osteoporosis. Paget disease (C) is characterized by increased deposition of poor-quality bone that is typically seen in adults older than 55 years and not seen in children."

{
    "question": "Which of the following is seen in both osteomalacia and osteoporosis?",
    "choices": [
        "Elevated bone alkaline phosphatase",
        "Frequent bone fractures",
        "Low vitamin D levels",
        "Hypocalcemia"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is frequent bone fractures (B). Both disorders lead to weakened bone, making them prone to fractures. Elevated alkaline phosphatase (A) is indicative of high bone turnover, typically seen in hyperparathyroidism rather than in osteomalacia or osteoporosis. Low vitamin D levels (C) are associated with osteomalacia but not osteoporosis. Hypocalcemia (D) is common in osteomalacia due to vitamin D deficiency but not in osteoporosis."

        "Type II collagen",
        "Type IV collagen"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is hydroxyapatite (B). Hydroxyapatite and type I collagen are the major components of bone matrix. Chondroitin sulfate (A) and type II collagen (D) are both major components of cartilage. Nitric oxide (C) is a gaseous signaling molecule, and type IV collagen (E) is a major component of the basal lamina in epithelial tissue."

    "question": "Where in a developing long bone does the secondary ossification center form?",
    "choices": [
        "Diaphysis",
        "Epiphysis",
        "Growth plate",
        "Medullary cavity",
        "Metaphysis"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is epiphysis (B). During endochondral ossification, the secondary ossification center arises after birth and involves the same process of blood vessel and osteogenic cell invasion that occurs in the primary ossification center. In long bones, the primary ossification center is located in the diaphysis (A), but the secondary ossification center is located in the epiphysis. The growth plate (C) is a portion of the metaphysis (E) that maintains cartilage after secondary ossification occurs and continues to grow before becoming ossified in adolescence. The medullary cavity (D) of long bones is a space in the diaphysis that stores red and yellow bone marrow."

    "question": "High serum levels of which of the following would lead to decreased bone resorption?",
    "choices": [
        "Calcium",
        "Interleukin 6",
        "Parathyroid hormone",
        "RANK ligand"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is calcium (A). High serum calcium would suppress parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, which would lower bone resorption. Bone resorption is done by osteoclasts, and their activity is stimulated by parathyroid hormone (via osteoblast release of RANK ligand) and IL-6. IL-6 (B), PTH (C), and RANKL (D) all increase osteoclast activity and increase bone resorption."

    "question": "A 6-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician by his mother. She says she has noticed that he isn’t able to see or hear as well as he used to. She states that other members of her family have had a similar condition. On x-ray, sclerotic thickened dense bones are seen. Which of the following cell types is not appropriately secreting protons in this condition?",
    "choices": [
        "Monocytes",
        "Osteoblast",
        "Osteoclast",
        "Platelets"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is osteoclast (C). Osteoclasts secrete protons for bone resorption. In osteopetrosis, some patients have a defect in carbonic anhydrase II in osteoclasts, leading to an inability to secrete protons and thus loss of normal bone resorption. Monocytes (A) can differentiate into osteoclasts; however, they do not directly secrete protons for bone resorption. Osteoblasts (B) build bone by secreting collagen. Platelets (D) do not cause osteopetrosis; however, in osteopetrosis, replacing bone marrow can lead to low levels of platelets."

        "Autosomal recessive",
        "Combination of genetic and environmental factors",
        "X-linked recessive"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is autosomal dominant (A). Achondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. It is caused by a mutation in FGFR3 that leads to short stature with a normal head size. Autosomal recessive (B), genetic and environmental factors (C), and X-linked recessive (D) are all incorrect."

    "question": "A 4-year-old child is brought to the emergency department with multiple fractures on his left hand, right femur, and left tibia. The parents report he fell while playing with his siblings. They deny any family history of genetic conditions. On physical exam, you notice bruising on the body and white sclera. The child is crying but able to hear and respond to you. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
        "Achondroplasia",
        "Child abuse",
        "Osteogenesis imperfecta",
        "Syndactyly"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is child abuse (B). Multiple fractures in a young child and the presence of bruising raise suspicion for child abuse. Furthermore, the presence of white sclera, ability to hear properly, and lack of family history of any genetic conditions make osteogenesis imperfecta less likely. In achondroplasia (A), bone growth is stunted, but multiple fractures are not typical. In osteogenesis imperfecta (C), you would often expect to see blue sclera, hearing loss, and indication of family history of the condition. In syndactyly (D), the digits are abnormally fused together; it is not related to frequency of bruising and fractures."

    "question": "Which of the following is required for forearm pronation to occur?",
    "choices": [
        "Abduction of the carpal bones at the wrist",
        "Abduction of the ulna at the elbow",
        "Adduction of the ulna at the elbow",
        "Independent, non-joined radius and ulna",
        "Rotation of the radius against the humerus"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is rotation of the radius against the humerus (E). Pronation of the forearm occurs when the radius rotates against the humerus and twists over the ulna, flipping the hand position 180°. The rotation can occur because the concave head of the radius articulates with the rounded capitulum of the humerus. Pronation occurs in the forearm, not the wrist, and the carpal bones do not adduct (A). There is no abduction of the ulna (B) or radius (C) at the elbow, only flexion and extension. The radius and ulna are not independent and non-joined (D); they are joined at the proximal and distal radioulnar joints, which are part of the elbow and wrist, respectively."

    "question": "A 78-year-old female comes to you 2 days after she fell forward and landed on her outstretched arm. She reports pain at her lateral wrist since then. You palpate her hand in the space between the extensor pollicis longus, the extensor pollicis brevis, and the abductor pollicis longus and can reproduce the pain. Which of the following is her most likely injury?",
    "choices": [
        "Adhesive capsulitis",
        "Pisiform fracture",
        "Radius fracture",
        "Scaphoid fracture",
        "Ulnar fracture"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is scaphoid fracture (D). The scaphoid sits at the base of the anatomic snuffbox on the lateral dorsum of the hand, formed from the tendons of the extensor pollicis longus, the extensor pollicis brevis, and the abductor pollicis longus. The carpal scaphoid bone is often fractured after a fall on an outstretched hand. Adhesive capsulitis (A) occurs with repetitive trauma to the glenohumeral joint, causing formation of adhesions. The pisiform (B) is another carpal bone but is not near the anatomic snuffbox. Distal fractures of the radius (C) or ulna (E) present with wrist swelling."

        "Glenohumeral joint",
        "Interphalangeal joint of the thumb",
        "Sternoclavicular joint"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is interphalangeal (IP) joint of the thumb (D). All the interphalangeal joints of the digits are hinge joints, with full flexion and limited extension. The acromioclavicular joint (A) connects the scapula to the clavicle and is a simple plane (sliding) joint. The carpometacarpal joint of the thumb (B) is a saddle joint that allows motion in multiple planes, including opposition. The glenohumeral (shoulder) joint (C) is a ball-and-socket joint allowing motion in all directions. The sternoclavicular joint (E) is a flexible saddle joint that allows motion in multiple directions."

        "Adductor pollicis",
        "Flexor digitorum profundus",
        "Flexor digitorum superficialis"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is adductor pollicis (C). The adductor pollicis is an intrinsic muscle of the hand that adducts the thumb, moving it toward the midline in the palmar plane. The abductor pollicis brevis (A) is an intrinsic hand muscle that abducts the thumb, moving it away from the midline. The abductor pollicis longus (B) also abducts the thumb and originates in the forearm, so it is not an intrinsic hand muscle. The flexor digitorum profundus (D) and superficialis (E) are forearm muscles that flex digits 2-5."

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is the extensor carpi radialis brevis, extensor digitorum, extensor digiti minimi, and extensor carpi ulnaris (B). These are the extensor muscles of the posterior forearm that originate from the lateral epicondyle or common extensor origin. Overuse of the extensors stresses extensor tendons, leading to pain over the lateral condyle, or tennis elbow."

        "Opponens pollicis",
        "Palmar interossei"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is flexor digitorum superficialis (A). This muscle originates in the forearm and crosses the wrist, flexing digits 2-5. The other listed options are all intrinsic to the hand, with origins and insertions in the wrist or more distal. The flexor pollicis brevis (B) flexes the thumb. The lumbricals (C) flex the first phalanx and extend the second and third phalanges. The opponens pollicis (D) opposes the thumb against the fifth finger. The palmar interossei (E) adduct the fingers to midline."

    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is deep palmar arch (D). The radial artery crosses the wrist and is largely responsible for creating the deep palmar arch, which supplies many of the intrinsic muscles of the fingers. The axillary (B) and brachial (C) arteries are proximal to the radial artery. The anterior interosseous artery (A) is a branch of the ulnar artery (E), which is not a branch of the radial artery but is a branch of the more proximal brachial artery."

        "Right cephalic vein",
        "Right lymphatic duct",
        "Thoracic duct"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is right lymphatic duct (D). The lymph from the extremities does not run through upper extremity veins (C) but instead runs through lymphatics, moving to the right or left lymphatic duct corresponding to the right or left extremity. From there, the lymphatic ducts empty into the corresponding subclavian vein or internal jugular vein. The lymph would not enter the inferior vena cava (A), which drains the lower extremities and abdomen. It would not enter the left subclavian vein (B), because that drains the left upper extremity, abdomen, and lower extremities via the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct (E) is another name for the left lymphatic duct, which drains the left upper extremity, not the right."

On physical exam, his wrist extensor strength is 1/5, and there is impaired sensation over the back of the hand. He sheepishly admits that he may have fallen asleep with his arm over a chair while at a party last night. Which of the following nerves is most likely injured?",
    "choices": [
        "Axillary nerve",
        "C5 spinal nerve",
        "Median nerve",
        "Radial nerve",
        "Upper trunk of brachial plexus"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is the radial nerve (D). Compression of the radial nerve at the radial groove often occurs in people who fall asleep with their arm over a chair. The injury to the radial nerve leads to loss of extensor function, wrist drop, and impaired sensation over the back of the hand. The axillary nerve (A) is injured by anterior dislocation of the humerus or fracture of the surgical neck, leading to impaired arm abduction and sensation over the shoulder. The C5 spinal nerve (B) is injured in a radiculopathy due to disc disease, leading to weak upper arm abduction and numbness over the shoulder and lateral upper arm. A median nerve injury (C) leads to loss of flexion of the first three digits (the hand of benediction) if proximal, usually due to a humerus fracture. Distal median nerve injury leads to impaired thenar sensation and muscle function, usually due to carpal tunnel compression of the nerve. Injury to the upper trunk of the brachial plexus (E) is Erb-Duchenne palsy and leads to the waiter tip deformity, due to a paralysis of the arm that occurs with extreme separation of the shoulder from the neck."

    "explanation": "The correct answer is acetaminophen (A). The patient is an older woman with unilateral joint pain and stiffness that is relieved with rest and made worse with movement—classical symptoms of osteoarthritis. This is first treated with simple analgesics like acetaminophen, which has fewer adverse effects than NSAIDs like ibuprofen (C). Arthrocentesis (B) is done for inflammatory joint diseases to rule out crystal-induced disease (e.g., gout) and infection (septic joint) but is rarely done in OA, which is non-inflammatory. Methotrexate (D) is not used in OA but is in rheumatoid arthritis. MRI (E) is rarely needed in diagnosing OA, where the diagnosis is clinical or uses a simple x-ray."

        "Age of 50 years",
        "High serum cholesterol",
        "Obesity",
        "Smoking"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is obesity (C). Obesity is a well-established risk factor for osteoarthritis. Increased weight puts extra stress at the weight-bearing joints such as the hips and knees. So there is more rubbing between the bones at the joint space, resulting in repetitive insults. Age of 50 years (A) is not old enough; osteoarthritis is mostly evident in patients older than 65 years. High cholesterol in the blood (B) might be associated with increased body weight, but it is not directly associated with osteoarthritis. Smoking (D) is associated mostly with poor healing of wounds and bone fractures; it is not considered one of the major risk factors of osteoarthritis."

        "Subchondral sclerosis",
        "Thickening of the synovial membrane"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is subchondral sclerosis (C). This is the thickening of the end of bones at the joint space and is one of the late features in advanced osteoarthritis. Deposition of crystals at the joint space (A) is the hallmark of crystal-induced arthritis, such as gout and calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease; it is not seen in osteoarthritis. Necrosis at the end of long bones (B) is incorrect. Necrosis means death, and this is not a feature of osteoarthritis; rather, in children, a condition called Perthes disease is commonly associated with the necrosis of the head of the femur. Thickening of the synovial membrane (D) is commonly seen in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a result of severe inflammation and activation of the immune system. In osteoarthritis, there is only mild inflammation when compared with RA, because the main cause of osteoarthritis is mechanical wear and tear and not activation of the immune system."

        "Normal calcium, phosphate, and bone alkaline phosphatase"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is normal calcium, phosphate, and bone alkaline phosphatase (E). In contrast to disorders like hyperparathyroidism that markedly increase bone turnover and the level of bone alkaline phosphatase, osteoporosis shows normal lab values except for increased 24-hour urine calcium. Osteomalacia and rickets due to vitamin D deficiency show low calcium and phosphate with increased bone turnover and alkaline phosphatase (B). Hyperparathyroidism shows increased calcium, decreased phosphate, and increased alkaline phosphatase (C). Paget disease of bone usually results in normal serum calcium, normal serum phosphate, and increased bone alkaline phosphatase (D)."

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is T-score ≤ −2.5 (B). Osteoporosis is diagnosed as having a DEXA T-score of less than or equal to −2.5, which suggests that an individual has a bone mineral density 2.5 standard deviations or more below the average bone mineral density for a healthy individual of the same sex and ethnicity. A T-score ≤ 2.5 (A) does not necessarily diagnose a patient as having osteoporosis because their bone mineral density could still be close to or above the average bone mineral density for a healthy individual of the same sex and ethnicity. A T-score ≥ 2.5 (C) actually suggests greater bone density than the average bone mineral density for a healthy individual of the same sex and ethnicity. A T-score ≥ −2.5 (D) could be suggestive of osteopenia, which is indicated by a T-score between −1.0 and −2.5."

    "choices": [
        "First phalanx",
        "Metacarpal",
        "Radius",
        "Scaphoid",
        "Ulna"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is metacarpal (B). A boxer fracture involves a break in the fifth metacarpal bone near the knuckle and commonly occurs when a person punches something with a closed fist. Phalangeal fractures (A) are caused by turning or twisting fingers. Distal radius (C) and ulnar fractures (E) are caused by wrist injuries. Scaphoid fractures (D) are a type of wrist fracture leading to pain in the wrist joint."

    "question": "A 28-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of weakness in the fingers of his right hand. One week ago, he experienced sudden pain in his right forearm during weight training. He has no history of serious illness. Physical examination shows impaired flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joints, while flexion of the distal interphalangeal joints is intact. Which of the following muscles is most likely injured?",
    "choices": [
        "Palmaris longus",
        "Flexor carpi radialis",
        "Flexor carpi ulnaris",
        "Flexor digitorum superficialis",
        "Flexor digitorum profundus"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is flexor digitorum superficialis (D). The flexor digitorum superficialis muscle, which originates from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and proximal shaft of the radius, enables flexion of the wrist, metacarpophalangeal joints, and proximal interphalangeal joints. Isometric weight training can cause rupture of this muscle, as seen here. Flexion of the distal interphalangeal joints is a function of the flexor digitorum profundus muscle and is unaffected by flexor digitorum superficialis muscle injury."

    "question": "A 41-year-old woman comes to the doctor because of gradually progressive weakness in her right hand over the past few weeks. She goes to the gym to lift weights 5 times a week. With the dorsum of the right hand on a flat surface, the patient is unable to move her thumb to touch a pen held 2 cm above the interphalangeal joint of the thumb. An MRI of the right arm shows compression of a nerve that passes through the pronator teres muscle. Based on the examination findings, loss of innervation of which of the following muscles is most likely in this patient?",
    "choices": [
        "Adductor pollicis",
        "Flexor pollicis longus",
        "First dorsal interosseous",
        "Abductor pollicis brevis",
        "Extensor pollicis brevis"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is abductor pollicis brevis (D). This patient shows signs of weakness of the abductor pollicis brevis. The abductor pollicis brevis is a muscle of the thenar eminence that arises from the flexor retinaculum and the scaphoid bone, before inserting into the proximal phalanx and the capsule of the first metacarpophalangeal joint. This muscle is responsible for thumb abduction, extension, and opposition. Damage to the median nerve leads to a weakness of these functions, especially abduction, which can be assessed by the pen test. Repetitive activities such as weight-lifting can cause median nerve injury by direct compression or entrapment."

    "question": "Which of the following is seen in patients with Marfan syndrome but not Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?",
    "choices": [
        "Aortic root dilation",
        "Brittle bones",
        "Flexible joints",
        "Lens dislocation",
        "Stretchy skin"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is lens dislocation (D). It is a unique feature of Marfan syndrome. Aortic root dilatation (A) and flexible joints (C) are shared features of Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS). Brittle bones (B) is seen in neither; it is a feature of osteogenesis imperfecta. Stretchy skin (E) is characteristic of EDS but not Marfan syndrome."

{
    "question": "Abnormalities of which of the following is least likely in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?",
    "choices": [
        "Collagen types I-V fibrils",
        "Collagen III DNA",
        "Collagen III posttranslational processing",
        "Collagen V mRNA",
        "Elastin"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is elastin (E). Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is due to collagen type III or type V synthesis defects or instability, whereas Marfan syndrome is due to elastin defects. EDS defects can be in the collagen III or V (DNA) (B), in the mRNA resulting from the mutated gene (D), in posttranslational processing (C), or in the inability of the defective collagen V to form fibrils with collagen I (A)."

    "question": "Which condition listed below is correlated with the correct gene mutation?",
    "choices": [
        "EDS, FBN1",
        "EDS, TGF-β",
        "Marfan, COL3A1",
        "Marfan, COL5A1",
        "Marfan, FBN1"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is Marfan, FBN1 (E). The FBN1 gene encodes a fibrillin molecule, which gives stability to tropoelastin during synthesis. It is not related to EDS pathophysiology (A). TGF-β expression (B) may be altered in Marfan syndrome but not in EDS. COL3A1 (C) and COL5A1 (D) may be defective in EDS, not in Marfan syndrome."

    "question": "A professional basketball player collapsed to the ground during a game and was found to have an enlarging aortic dissection. History revealed that his father died very young with similar symptoms. His genetic and clinical testing is consistent with Marfan syndrome. Which of the following findings would be least likely in this patient?",
    "choices": [
        "Dislocated eye lens",
        "Long extremities",
        "Long fingers",
        "Intellectual disability",
        "Tall stature"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is intellectual disability (D). Aortic dissection is a characteristic complication of Marfan syndrome. Lens dislocation (A), long extremities (B), long fingers (C), and tall stature (E) are all characteristics of Marfan syndrome. However, intellectual disability is not associated with it."

    "question": "A 55-year-old man presents to the hospital with severe foot pain, specifically in his left big toe. The left proximal interphalangeal joint is swollen and red. His serum uric acid level is 9.2 mg/dL. A joint aspirate shows a WBC count of 40,000/mm³ and negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",
    "choices": [
        "Allopurinol",
        "Codeine",
        "Hydroxychloroquine",
        "Indomethacin",
        "Methotrexate"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is indomethacin (D). The patient has symptoms and joint findings indicative of acute gout, which is best treated initially with an NSAID like indomethacin. Allopurinol (A) lowers serum uric acid levels but is not used in acute gout because it may precipitate acute attacks. It is used in chronic gout for prevention of acute attacks later. Codeine (B) is an analgesic that might reduce pain but not inflammation, so it is not indicated in acute gout. Hydroxychloroquine (C) is an antimalarial medication used in some types of chronic CPPD but not acute gout. Methotrexate (E) is prescribed for some chronic forms of CPPD but not acute gout."

    "question": "A 67-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus has been experiencing joint pain for the past few years. He describes pain, mainly in the small joints of his hands, associated with morning stiffness. Analysis of synovial fluid aspirated from an affected joint reveals crystals that are blue when parallel to the projection of polarized light. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
        "Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease",
        "Gout",
        "Osteoarthritis",
        "Rheumatoid arthritis"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (A). In CPPD, aspiration of affected joints will yield synovial fluid that contains rhomboid crystals weakly positively birefringent under polarized light. This means that crystals will be blue when parallel to the projection of polarized light and yellow when perpendicular. Gout (B) may present with similar symptoms. However, aspirated synovial fluid will demonstrate needle-shaped crystals that have negative birefringence, meaning that they will be yellow when parallel to the projection of polarized light. In osteoarthritis (C) and rheumatoid arthritis (D), analysis of the synovial fluid under polarized light will not reveal crystals."

    "question": "A 58-year-old man presents to the emergency department with pain and redness in multiple joints, including the metatarsophalangeal joint of his big toe. He reports that over the past several years, he has had numerous such occurrences. Plain radiograph of the patient’s right foot demonstrates multiple bone erosions in the toes. After treating the patient's acute symptoms, which of the following medications, administered long-term, would most likely prevent a recurrence?",
    "choices": [
        "Allopurinol",
        "Colchicine",
        "Ibuprofen",
        "Prednisone"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is allopurinol (A). This patient is currently experiencing an acute gout attack. However, given his long history of such attacks as well as radiographic evidence of bone erosions, he also has chronic gout. First-line treatment of chronic gout, as well as prophylaxis to prevent future acute attacks, is allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. Colchicine (B), NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (C), and steroids (D) are effective in treating acute gout attacks but are not used as prophylaxis."

    "question": "A 55-year-old man presents to his physician describing left hip pain for the past 2 years. He has no fever, and the pain is worse with movement and relieved by rest. He also has early morning stiffness. Apart from mild swelling, the skin overlying his left hip looks normal. His CRP value is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
        "Ankylosing spondylitis",
        "Gout",
        "Osteoarthritis",
        "Reactive arthritis",
        "Septic arthritis"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is osteoarthritis (C). This patient has joint pain that is worse with movement and relieved with rest, without any systemic signs and symptoms, and osteoarthritis is the most probable diagnosis. The normal CRP confirms a noninflammatory arthritis, of which osteoarthritis is the most common cause."

    "question": "A 54-year-old man presents to his physician because of morning stiffness and pain in his left knee and right wrist that has been increasing for several weeks. The exam shows redness and swelling in both of these joints. His serum rheumatoid factor is elevated. A joint aspiration would most likely show which of the following?",
    "choices": [
        "Gram-positive cocci",
        "Needle-shaped crystals",
        "Rhomboid crystals",
        "WBC count 1000/mm³",
        "WBC count 7500/mm³"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is WBC count 7500/mm³ (E). Acute arthritis is best evaluated with a joint aspiration. This patient with morning stiffness and inflammation, and a positive rheumatoid factor, most likely has rheumatoid arthritis. This shows inflammatory joint aspirate, typically with a WBC count of 2000-50,000 /mm³."

    "B. Osteogenesis imperfecta",
    "C. Osteoporosis",
    "D. Osteopetrosis",
    "E. Rickets"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "D",
  "explanation": "The correct answer is osteopetrosis (D). Osteopetrosis is characterized by thickened and dense bones due to defective osteoclast function. It often presents with multiple fractures, dental issues like carious teeth, and a family history. Unlike osteogenesis imperfecta, which is associated with blue sclera, patients with osteopetrosis typically have normal or white sclera."

    "question": "A 68-year-old woman presents to her physician with a history of osteoporosis. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) reveals a significant reduction in bone density, particularly in the vertebrae and proximal femur. The physician explains that the changes in bone density mainly affect a specific type of bone structure that is more metabolically active. Which of the following bone structures is primarily affected in this patient’s condition?",
    "choices": [
        "A: Cortical bone",
        "B: Woven bone",
        "C: Trabecular bone (spongy bone)",
        "D: Periosteum",
        "E: Articular cartilage"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Trabecular bone, also known as spongy bone, is more metabolically active and has a higher surface area compared to cortical bone. It is found predominantly in areas like the vertebrae and the ends of long bones. Osteoporosis primarily affects trabecular bone, leading to an increased risk of fractures in these areas. Cortical bone, which is denser and makes up the outer layer of bones, is also affected by osteoporosis but to a lesser extent."
